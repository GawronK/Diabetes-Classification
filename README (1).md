# Diabetes Classification

The aim of the project is to create classification models to predict the presence of diabetes based on a set of medical data. The problem is the use of different algorithms machine learning to predict the outcome (presence or absence of diabetes) based on features such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, etc.

##  Setup

To setup environment run the following command in cmd

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Used algorithms
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM) 

K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) 

Self-Implemented Custom Perceptron (OVR) and Custom KNN
